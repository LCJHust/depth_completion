# Depth Completion Selection

## Introduction

This code is based on our work [Sparsity Invariant CNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06500.pdf).
It is a collection of simple networks to do the task of depth completion on the [KITTI depth completion challenge](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_completion).

Feedback and code contributions are highly appreciated.

## Installation

To use this code, I recommend to install tensorflow and keras.

### tensorflow
I prefer to install tensorflow using anaconda:
